# STEEM AVATARS GENERATOR
Random avatar generator created for the community of STEEM platforms. 

Some STEEM users don't like uploading their own picture to the platfrom for security or privacy reasons. Our goal with this project is to provide all the users a nice option of graphics for their profile picture, so they have something funny and don't compromise their privacity.

The idea is based on the website [cat avatar generator](https://www.peppercarrot.com/extras/html/2016_cat-generator/index.php) by David Revoy and Andreas Gohr. 

## Getting Started
If you want to use this project for learning or to make your own project, just fork this repository or download it to your PC. You need a code editor software like ATOM and a server in order to open .php files.

## Testing
Just open the index.php file.
